This repository contains the code and report for the TU Berlin's Machine
Learning Lab Course assignments from Klaus-Robert MÃ¼ller. 


Assignment 1:
The assignment involves the study, implementation and application of algorithms
for dimension reduction (PCA, LLE), evaluation (AUC) and outlier detection (Gamma
idx, Kappa idx and others). 

Assignment 2:
The assignment involves the study, implementation and application of algorithms
for clustering algorithms. In particular, k-Means, Gaussian MixtureModels, 
Agglomorative Clustering are investigated.
